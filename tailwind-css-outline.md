# Technology Outline

## Purpose

This is a sandbox repo dedicated to a specific technology, that technology is: Tailwind.CSS

The content of this repo is intended to be comprised of code created with this technology independent of other technologies, but doesn't necessarily exclude the use of other technologies, especially when the main technology is dependent on or heavily used in conjuction with other technologies.

This repo was created and maintained mainly by developer AJC. This outline is meant to overview the developers personal understanding and application of the technology, as such it includes personal observations and documentation that represents the domain of the developers knowledge. The documentation listed in this outline isn't intended to comprehensively document the technology, but when documentation mirrors official documentation, it is intended to be a reflection of the developers understanding and actualy knowledge of the technology alongside any specific highly relevant key points to the developers personal application and experience with the technology.

## Technology Overview

Tailwind CSS is a CSS framework. It's primary feature is the usage of utility classes.

### Fundamentals

Tailwind CSS utilizes utility classes to apply HTML elemental styling. It's best to understand this in the context of contrast to other CSS frameworks that are highly ubiquitous like Bootstrap.

Any developer who works on the frontend is familiar with the usage of CSS classes. They are unavoidable, but creating our own classes can require extensive time and development. It also happens to be that using frameworks tend to improve efficiency since due to their ubiquity they are often already pre-loaded by the end-users browser, and we are able to make use of them across sites for better performance. Almost any front end developer will therefore begin to rely on a CSS framework to some extent.

Bootstrap is well known to most developers operating on the frontend. It's a CSS framework that provides a set of pre-defined classes that can be applied to HTML elements to style them. Tailwind CSS is similar in that it provides a set of pre-defined classes that can be applied to HTML elements to style them. The difference is in the approach to the classes.

#### Tailwind vs Bootstrap

Bootstrap classes are designed to be semantic. They are named to describe the styling they apply. For example, `btn` is a class that applies button styling to an element. `btn-primary` is a class that applies primary button styling to an element. `btn-secondary` is a class that applies secondary button styling to an element. This is a semantic approach to styling.

Tailwind classes are designed to be utility classes. They are named to describe the styling they apply, but they are not semantic. For example, `bg-blue-500` is a class that applies a blue background to an element. `text-white` is a class that applies white text to an element. `rounded-lg` is a class that applies rounded corners to an element. This is a utility approach to styling.

Tailwind as a framework in contrast to Bootstrap is mostly defined by what it doesn't do, rather than what it does.
