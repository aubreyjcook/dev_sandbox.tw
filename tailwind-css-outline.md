# Technology Outline

## Purpose

This is a sandbox repo dedicated to a specific technology, that technology is: Tailwind.CSS

The content of this repo is intended to be comprised of code created with this technology independent of other technologies, but doesn't necessarily exclude the use of other technologies, especially when the main technology is dependent on or heavily used in conjuction with other technologies.

This repo was created and maintained mainly by developer AJC. This outline is meant to overview the developers personal understanding and application of the technology, as such it includes personal observations and documentation that represents the domain of the developers knowledge. The documentation listed in this outline isn't intended to comprehensively document the technology, but when documentation mirrors official documentation, it is intended to be a reflection of the developers understanding and actualy knowledge of the technology alongside any specific highly relevant key points to the developers personal application and experience with the technology.

## Technology Overview

Tailwind CSS is a CSS framework. It's primary feature is the usage of utility classes.

### Fundamentals

Tailwind CSS utilizes utility classes to apply HTML elemental styling. It's best to understand this in the context of contrast to other CSS frameworks that are highly ubiquitous like Bootstrap. 

Bootstrap uses a component based approach, where you apply classes to elements to create components. Tailwind CSS uses utility classes to apply styles directly to elements. This means that you can apply styles to elements without having to create a component or apply a class to a component. This is a very powerful feature that allows for rapid prototyping and development.
